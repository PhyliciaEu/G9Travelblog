It is composed of three lanes and seven lanes, hence the name.

<p>“Yong” means “pouring out” and “quan” means “spring” in Chinese. Yongquan Temple (涌泉寺) gets its name because there is a spring pouring out in front of it. Being “One of The Most Sacred Temples in Fujian”, Yongquan Temple is usually a must-visit. The temple is located at the western side of the large Gushan (Drum Mountain) Scenic Area. Visitors heading to Yongquna Temple will also enjoy hiking or biking in Gushan Scenic Area.</p>

<p>White Tower and Black Tower
White Tower (白塔) was built by Wang Shenzhi, the King of old Ancient Fujian of this region, to repay the kindness of his father and brother. The tower is named White tower because its outside appearance is coated with white ash layer. The seven-layer Black Tower (乌塔), or called Wu Tower, faces the southeast side of White Tower in a distance. The tower is in black color after weathering, hence the name. The two towers are two landmarks of Fuzhou.</p>
